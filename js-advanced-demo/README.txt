Advanced JavaScript and asynchronous functions intro
====================================

Hello, and welcome to an intro to advanced JavaScript, with context about how we actually use JavaScript in 
our automation framework. There are lots of advanced concepts that we could cover, but the ones you will need 
for getting started with writing automated scenarios in our repository are arrow functions, promises 
and async/await.

For the files in this folder, go through them in the following order:
1 - async_resources.txt
If you are totally new to the concept of asynchronous functions and promises, you will want to start
with this file, and go through some of the resources linked. There are videos, documentation and
interactive walkthroughs to get you familiar with the concepts we will be covering.

If you are already familiar with these concepts, feel free to look at some of the resources as a refresher, but 
you can also move on to part 2.

2 - async_intro.js
This is a basic explanation of how we use async/await in our automated scripts, with actual examples
pulled directly from our repsitory. This will give you a better idea of exactly how we use these concepts, and why.

3 - why_async.js
We've received feedback that people wanted more information on why we want to use async/await arrow functions. This 
file is a quick explanation from someone on the GQA Framework team which covers why we have chosen to go this direction.

This is optional reading, but may be helpful for SDETs to understand the style decisions that have been made.

4 - practice_async.js
This is a walkthrough that we can do together as a team. Some of the functions are partially written, and as a team,
we'll finish them with the information we learned in async_intro.js

5 - practice_arrow_functions.js
This file has some functions listed. Your task is to transform them into arrow functions.
